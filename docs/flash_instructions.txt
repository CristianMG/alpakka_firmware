How to put devices into Bootsel mode
------------------------------------
- If the device is factory new, it will go into Bootsel mode automatically when connected.
- If the device has an old firmware installed, there are multiple ways:
  - Option 1: Use the Ctrl app > Tools > Commands > Restart in bootsel mode.
  - Option 2: In the controller, hold Home+Select while the controller is connected via USB.
  - Option 3: In the Alpakka v1, double press the reset button next to the USB port (see manual).
  - Option 4: In the Alpakka v0, hold the white button in the Raspberry Pico while connecting the USB cable.
  - Option 5: In the dongle, hold the multifunction button while connecting the USB cable.


Flash Alpakka v0 controller (with Raspberry Pico core)
------------------------------------------------------
- Put the controller in Boolsel mode (RPI-RP2 drive appears).
- Copy "alpakka_pico.uf2" to RPI-RP2 drive.
- Controller turns on automatically (LEDs blinking).


Flash Alpakka v1 controller (with Marmota core)
-----------------------------------------------
- Put the controller in Boolsel mode (RPI-RP2 drive appears).
- Copy "wireless_submodule.uf2" to RPI-RP2 drive.
- Wait until the blinking LED stops, and RPI-RP2 re-appears (~30 seconds).
- Copy "alpakka_marmota.uf2" to RPI-RP2 drive.
- Controller turns on automatically (LEDs blinking).


Flash Dongle (with Marmota core)
--------------------------------
- Put the dongle in Boolsel mode (RPI-RP2 drive appears).
- Copy "wireless_submodule.uf2" to RPI-RP2 drive.
- Wait until the blinking LED stops, and RPI-RP2 re-appears (~30 seconds).
- Copy "dongle_marmota.uf2" to RPI-RP2 drive.
- Dongle turns on automatically (LED is on).


After flashing
--------------
- A horizontal-vertical LED blinking pattern means calibration is missing (or other problems).
- Check the manual about how to calibrate.
- If the LED warning pattern persist after calibration, check Ctrl app logs.
